# AI-Virtual-Keyboard
AI project 
This is the project made by Vinit Mehra 065, Linu Shibu 105, Siddharth Sawhney 120 for the Artificial Intelligence Course.
In this project, we have tried to reduce the gap between the real world and the augmented environment to produce a mixed reality system. 
For that purpose, we created a virtually controllable keyboard system which is created and implemented using OpenCV libraries and python. 
To provide an easy immersive augmented experience which is also gesture enabled, we employ a web camera which is integrated with OpenCV libraries through a compiler. 
Using our system, users can control a virtual keyboard using their finger movements and finger tips.
